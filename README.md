# Odin Landing Page

HTML/CSS only web page project for The Odin Project.

## Skills Learned

### Advanced CSS
This project allowed me to dive deeper into CSS, learning about more obscure properties and the way they affect the rendered web page.

### Flexbox
This project has taught me how to arrange a web page layout with CSS's flexbox by changing box directions and using gaps or grow/shrink values to position elements at the desired spot. I also have acquired some experience with responsive design using flexbox, by trying to prevent elements from dissapearing off-screen and instead making them wrap over the screen.
